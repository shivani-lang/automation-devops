Git (/ɡɪt/)[8] is a distributed version control system[9] that tracks versions of files. It is often used to control source code by programmers who are developing software collaboratively.

Design goals of Git include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows — thousands of parallel branches running on different computers.[10][11][12]

As with most other distribution.The git describe command is a useful tool in Git that provides a human-readable name for a given commit based on an available reference. It helps in identifying the current version of a project, especially when working with tags and releases. The command finds the most recent tag that is reachable from a commit and appends the number of additional commits on top of that tag, along with the abbreviated commit has hggkij uou t67t68 86t97y98 5e5e5e 7ytyy9<F8>7 4r6de64e 6 7y9770678 7r768769p 7fr75r7859p7 y9 9p87t86 uo86tr8tp7 ytfd7 fr6 ttufo8 7o6 86 o68 tro86 t y8y8p8t tfo7r 769 696 9  frd65r e7 786 878p
